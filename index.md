Hello! My name is Miles! Welcome to my website.
I am a small website developer and have an interest in speedcubing and Wii/3DS homebrew.
<br><br>
I have a Wii homebrew tutorial linked [here](https://mjfet.github.io/wiihb) if you are interested in softmodding your Wii.

I had an old website that was down for a year, but I got it back up! [https://mjfet.github.io/oldversion](https://mjfet.github.io/oldversion)
